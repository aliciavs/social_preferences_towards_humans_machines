    We will now give you detailed instructions. <b>Please read them carefully.</b> <br>

    You can only continue to the experiment and earn money if you answer these questions correctly.

<p>
    {{ if participant.treatment == "human" }}
        In this study, you will be randomly and anonymously <b>paired with another participant</b>. <br>
    {{ else }}
        In this study, you will be <b>playing with a computer</b>. <br>
    {{ endif }}
    One of you will act in the role of Player 1 and the other in the role of Player 2. <br> 
    Before you make any decisions you will be randomly assigned to a role and informed about the role.
</p>
<p>    
    {{ if participant.treatment == "machine earns" }}
        <b>The computer will keep the money it earns for itself.</b>
    {{ elif participant.treatment == "burned" }}
        <b>Nobody will receive the money that the computer earns.</b>
    {{ elif participant.treatment == "token" }}
        <b>Another participant will receive the money that the computer earns.</b>
    {{ elif participant.treatment == "programmer" }}
        <b>The programmer of the computer player will receive the money that the computer earns.</b>
    {{ endif }}
</p>
<p>
    Player 1 will repeatedly <b>decide how to split a certain amount</b> between him-/herself and Player 2. <br>
    Player 1 can always choose between two options of how to allocate the amount (Option X and Option Y). <br>
    In total, Player 1 will make such decisions in {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS_MAIN }} rounds. <br>
    In the end, one of these decisions will be selected at random and paid out.
